    "{\"filename\": \"1602_longlora_efficient_fine_tuning.pdf\", \"content\": \" The subsection provided compares various models to GPT-3.5-Turbo on long-context benchmarks, LongBench and LEval, and evaluates their win rates. The models compared are LongChat-7B, LongChat-v1.5-7B, Vicuna-v1.5-7B, and Ours-7B. The table shows the win-rate, wins, and ties for each model.\\n\\nBased on the information provided in the table, none of the models have a win-rate of 100%, meaning that none of them won against GPT-3.5-Turbo in all comparisons. Ours-7B has the highest win-rate of 39.06%, followed by LongChat-7B with a win-rate of 33.68%. Vicuna-v1.5-7B has the lowest win-rate of 25.52%.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the table only shows the results of comparisons on long-context benchmarks and does not provide information on the performance of the models on other types of tasks or datasets. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the overall performance of the models based on this table alone.\"}"
