The models compared are LongChat-7B, LongChat-v1.5-7B, Vicuna-v1.5-7B, and Ours-7B. The table shows the win-rate, wins, and ties for each model. The subsection also mentions that the models are fine-tuned to a 16384 context length and compares their performance with GPT-3.5-Turbo and other Llama2-based long-context models. The subsection also mentions a FLOPs profiling table for Llama2 7B on various context lengths and a training cost comparison table between Full Fine-Tuning, Plain LoRA, and LongLoRA.\n\nBased on the user prompt \"Which models were compared and what were their win rates?\", the relevant information from the subsection is:\n\n|Model|Win-rate|\n|---|---|\n|LongChat-7B (Li et al., 2023)|33.68|\n|LongChat-v1.5-7B (Li et al., 2023)|33.59|\n|Vicuna-v1.5-7B (Chiang et al., 2023)|25.52|\n|Ours-7B|39.06|\n\nThe win-rate is the percentage of wins out of the total number of matches played against GPT-3.5-Turbo. The higher the win-rate, the better the model performed.",
